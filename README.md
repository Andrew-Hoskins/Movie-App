# UsePopcorn
A dynamic movie search app built with React — find and track your favourite films!

UsePopcorn is a movie discovery React application that pulls real-time data from the IMDB database (via the OMDB API). The app lets you search movies by title, view posters and details, and maintain a watchlist for your session. The primary aim is to showcase fundamental and modern React concepts, including state management, props, and the useEffect hook for fetching API data.​

# Features

* View details such as Poster and Title
* Responsive UI built using React components

* State management using the useState hook

UsePopcorn is an educational project (jonas schmedtmann - Ultimate React Course) focused on modern React practices and integrating third-party APIs.
